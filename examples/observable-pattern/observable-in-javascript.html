		<p>
			It's 2016 and as a web application programmer, you must have heard of the term "Observables" by now. If you are
			programmer,
			there are 3 ways to tackle buzz words in industry where 6 months old is classic. You either reject it and block
			yourself
			from too much new stuff. Or, you either become an early adaptor having little to no knowledge of the technology
			but still
			try to use it in your projects at work not caring what's going on behind the scenes. The third kind of mindset can
			be
			different. You keep your eyes and mind open to buzz words, let them come your way. You dive deep into them and try
			to
			dig into the benefits it can give you over your current style of solving a particular problem.I have planned to do
			this
			series of observables in JavaScript taking the 3rd kind of mindset.

			<br /> Let's look at some foundational concepts behind Observables in JavaScript and what's the inspiration behind
			it.

			<h2>Patterns Behind Patterns</h2>
			The coolest thing about design patterns is that they are composable. You can join 2 or more patterns to create a
			new one.
			In order to wrap our head around Observables, we need to get a good grip of 2 software design patterns.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Observer Pattern
				</li>
				<li>
					Iterator Pattern
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>
				Observer Pattern
			</h1>

			<blockquote>
				The Pattern
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents
						are notified and
						updated automatically.
					</li>
					<li>
						Defines 2 abstractions:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Encapsulate core component in a Subject abstraction. They call it "Observable", the one that is being
								observed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Encapsulate variable components, something that can change or extend over time in an Observer hierarchy.
								They call these
								"Observers", usually a list of folks observing the observable.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				What I first thought
			</blockquote>

			In a perfect academic world, you may think of it like this. Suppose Subject (the Observable) has a state, say
			variables 'x'
			and 'y'. It also has an array, a list of folks to notify when there is a change in either 'x' or 'y'. When I first
			heard
			of Observer pattern, I thought the Observable might emit an event i.e. they will shout out loud and whoever is
			interested
			in listening to that particular event will get a notification and this notification may come with its payload, not
			necessarily.
			This is not actually an Observer pattern. This is a Publisher / Subscriber or more commonly known as a Pub/Sub
			pattern.
			You can think of Pub/Sub as an Observer pattern with more "broadcast" semantics. The subscriber of the event can
			be "anyone"
			and can do "anything". I will explain this "anyone" and "anything" up next.

			<blockquote>
				If you have done apps in Angular 1.x then you may have used $broadcast and $on to publish an event and subscribe
				to that
				event. The publisher has no knowledge of the subscribers, it just publishes/broadcasts/emits an event (with some
				event
				data may be) and in any related or unrelated object/component, if you have $on that listens to the same event,
				you will
				be able to get hold of that event. As I said, this pure pub/sub is more dynamic in nature where subscribers can
				subscribe
				and unsubscribe without informing the publisher and publisher does not even care. I am not talking about how bad
				or how
				good it is or in which scenario it can be beneficial, just trying to make my point on the nature of pure
				pub/sub.
			</blockquote>

			<br />
			<br />
			<blockquote>
				What it actually is
			</blockquote>

			Observer pattern is different from Subscriber pattern in that the Observable(Pub equivalent) "maintains a list" of
			its observers(Sub
			equivalent) and not "anyone" can listen to the changes in Observables. Observers explicitly ask Observables to add
			them
			to the observer list the Observable maintains.

			<h4>Observer Pattern in Code</h4>

			Since "Observables" are the ones producing the event, they are sometimes referred to as "Producers" or
			"Publishers" ( in
			a more pub/sub nature of things). The Observers are sometimes referred to as "Listeners" or "Subscribers" (in a
			more pub/sub
			nature of things).

			<br />
			<br /> Let's implement the Observer Pattern

			<pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">

          function Observable() {

            this.x = 0;
            this.observers = [];

          }

          //Attaches an observer to the observable
          Observable.prototype.add = function(observer){

            this.observers.push(observer);

          }

          //Removes an observer to the observable
          Observable.prototype.remove = function(observer){

            var index = this.observers.indexOf(observer);
            this.observers.splice(observer,1);

          }

          Observable.prototype.updateX = function(value){

            this.oldX = this.x;
            this.x = value || 0;
            this.notify({x:value,oldX:this.oldX,message:'X Updated'});

          }

          Observable.prototype.notify = function(payload){

            this.observers.forEach(function(observer){
                observer.update(payload);
            });

          }

        </code>
      </pre>

			<br /> Let's write observers(listeners) now and make use of our Observable.

			<pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">

      var observer1 = {

          update: function(payload){
                console.log("Observable pushes update to Observer 1 :",payload);
          }

      }

      var observer2 = {

          update: function(payload){
                console.log("Observable pushes update to Observer 2 :",payload);
          }

      }

      var obs = new Observable();

      obs.add(observer1);
      obs.add(observer2);

      obs.updateX(100);
      obs.updateX(200);
      obs.updateX(300);


        </code>
      </pre>

			<h3>What's interesting here</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					You have to explicitly ask Observable (obs) to add an observer to it's notification list.
					<br />
					<br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Push</b> over
					<b>Pull</b> nature.
					<br />
					<br /> Pull nature is common. Observer1 could have asked the Observable(obs) to tell what the value of 'x' is
					at some point
					in time. That's pulling/requesting/asking value from the Observable. But that's not the case here. Pull is not
					continuous.
					You pull/retrieve the value once and that's it. End of story. If you ever want the updated value again, you
					have to
					ask for it again.
					<br /> Push is different. Observable pushes the value of 'x' out to all of it's observers whenever 'x' get's
					updated. Push
					is continuous. Whenever the value of 'x' gets updated , all the observers receive the update. This will happen
					continuously
					until the observer asks the observable to remove it from it's notification list.
					<br />
					<br />
				</li>

				<li>

					Each observer needs to adhere to an interface. Where is the interface?. If you are an observer, in order to
					observe i.e to
					subscribe to our Observable(obs), you need to define a method 'update()' in yourself. The Observable than
					knows how
					to notify each observer calling it's 'update' method. It can be any name anything but it has to be common
					across all
					observers.

				</li>

			</ul>

			<h4>Real World Examples of Observer Pattern</h4>

			Where do we use or prefer pure Observer pattern?

			<ul>
				<li>
					When we need to listen to continuous streams with decoupled publisher(Observable) and subscriber(Observer).
				</li>
				<li>
					When we prefer Push over Pull behaviour.
				</li>
				<li>
					Examples:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Listening to continuous key strokes to get user input in a Search Box with type-ahead enabled.
						</li>
						<li>
							Continuous monitoring of mouse pointer position to see which section of the UI user hovers over. This can
							be used for several
							purposes but this discussion is out of scope of this article.
						</li>
						<li>
							A screen listing all the stocks. Since the stocks change continuously over time, the stock observable
							needs to push data
							to every observer.
						</li>
						<li>
							Any dashboard where charts plot live values. Each time there is an update on the sales, the Observable has
							to update the
							screen without user refreshing the page. In this scenario, a pub/sub with combination of pull can be
							helpful because
							a user might want to request for a specific value over time which is pulling the value rather than a push
							behaviour.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		</p>

		<h1>
			Iterator Pattern
		</h1>

		The other piece in the Observable puzzle is the Iterator Pattern.

		<blockquote>
			The Pattern
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying
					representation.
				</li>
				<li>
					"Polymorphic Traversal" is the name of the game!
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			Put it simply, we need to find an abstraction for the traversal of different data structures and create an
			algorithm which
			is capable of interacting with each type of the data structure transparently and in the same manner.
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Suppose you are creating a "Social Network Aggregator". You want all your social accounts to be hooked up together
			and shown
			to you on a single screen. There is a Search functional on this UI. You want to search for all your social friends
			across
			Facebook, Twitter, Linked In e.t.c. Each of these networks has their own libraries and ways of querying data. Each
			of
			them stores data in a different format. But as a user, typing a friends name in friend search textbox, does he
			care how
			different social network implements and stores their friends data differently? Obviously, they don't care and they
			want
			to traverse over their friend's list as if it's all coming from the same source with the exact same data
			structure. There
			has to be one and only way to traverse any list irrespective of what it's source is.
		</p>

		<p>
			The iterator pattern while traversing/iterating over a list only cares about 2 things,
			<ul>
				<li>
					Does the list have more data (that we are interested in)? Does the list 'has Next' data pointer?
				</li>
				<li>
					If it has more data, how can we get to the next data pointer?
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<br /> Let's implement the Iterator Pattern

		<pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">

            function multiplesIterator(list,divisor){

              this.cursor = 0;
              this.list = list;
              this.divisor = divisor;

            }

            multiplesIterator.prototype.next = function(){

              while(this.cursor < this.list.length){

                var value = this.list[this.cursor++];
                if(value%this.divisor === 0){

                  return value;

                }

              }

            };

            multiplesIterator.prototype.hasNext = function(){

              var cur = this.cursor;
              while(cur < this.list.length){
                  if(this.list[cur++] % this.divisor ===0){
                    return true;
                  }
              }

              return false;
            }


        </code>
        </pre> Let's make of our universal multiples iterator which can iterate over any integer array for any divisor.

		<pre>
          <code class="language-javascript">

              var list = [1,3,5,8,10,12,14,16,18,20];
              var divisor = 10;

              var iterable = new multiplesIterator(list,divisor);

              console.log(iterable.next(),iterable.hasNext());
              console.log(iterable.next(),iterable.hasNext());
              console.log(iterable.next(),iterable.hasNext());


          </code>
        </pre>


		<h3>What's interesting here</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				We have encapsulated traversing logic for any kind of list, any kind of data structure.
			</li>
			<li>
				Iterators are interesting when
				<ul>
					<li>
						Made generic to handle different types of data (Remember the Facebook/Twitter example?)
					</li>
					<li>
						When they can be configured at run time. (Like we did in our example passing in a list and divisor at run
						time)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			What's coming next?
		</h2>
		<p>
			This was episode#1 on our journey of unleashing Observables in JavaScript. We learned that Observables are based
			on the composition
			of Observer Pattern and Iterator Pattern. In our upcoming installments, we look into how can we do Functional
			Reactive
			Programming with RxJS and will also look into extensive Observable support build into Angular 2.
